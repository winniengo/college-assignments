Answer your experimental evaluation questions here:
1. Using 5-fold cross-validation, we achieved the best results using either k 
values of 2 or 3. These returned overall the highest accurary, sensitivity and 
specificity values. Notably each varied slightly per run but not enough to 
make a difference when compared to results using other k values. 

2. To pick k we should be using domain knowledge and internal model selection. 
Using cross-validation, our testing and training models are one and the same.
Because k-NN is a lazy algorithm, we never actually build a model. 

3. The J48 classifier performs a little worse than our k-NN algorithm. Their
accuracy rate was 72% while ours was 94% when using k = 3. Using features
with continuous values, the decision tree algorithm must create and use ranges
instead of defined features. These ranges could cause longer trees which tend
to overfit the data. Using k-NN, the influence of the value k is much stronger
than whether or not the values of the features are continous. Thus its 
performance is slightly better than that of J48. 

4. It removes redundancy and helps prevent overfitting. It also results in 
simpler trees which decreases the run-time of the algorithm.
