CS 68 Final Project READ ME
Winnie Ngo and Eric Oh

To run code use:
        
        python3 classifiers.py

Currently program is set to output accuracies of all supervised learning
algorithms trained and tested using n-folds cross validaion on the leukemia 
patient gene expression dataset found in datasets/. 

Additions:
- Filename can be changed to test other datasets. 
- Uncommenting the first line in main() allows user to input value for n for
n-folds cross validation. Comment the following line which sets n = 7, the
optimal value for testing our current dataset.
- Changing to following line so that display and plot are True displays
the confusion matrix per fold per classifier and plots the resulting 
hyperplane(s) of the SVMs using the two most weighted features. 

Protein Hot Spot Project:
The proteinHotSpotProject/ contains the files from our original project.
You will find the raw pdb files and corresponding alanine files. FADE,
MdEnergy and VADAR contains file generated from using these respective
softwares. MdEnergy contains information on the hydrogen bond energies
of each protein. FADE and VADAR would've yield addition energy information
if they had workd. They are currently installed on caper in the 
/local/cs68wngo1 directory. Additional software such as CHARMM19 and VMD
will also be found in that directory
