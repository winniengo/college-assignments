Actual Results - Most Common Words
(1) 'the'   f = 5580
(2) ','     f = 5188
(3) '.'     f = 4030
(4) 'of'    f = 2849
(5) 'and'   f = 2146
(6) 'to'    f = 2116
(7) 'a'     f = 1993
(8) 'in'    f = 1893
(9) 'for'   f = 943
(10) 'The'  f = 806

This list does not match our original expectations. For us, it was surprising
to see that pronouns such as 'I', 'he', 'she', and 'it' did not make the top
10 most common tokens. These are words that we expected to come up frequently,
especially in the 'news' category. We were also surprised that simple linking
verbs such as 'is' and 'are' were not among the top 10 most common tokens.

We found instead that prepositions were especially common, such as 'in', 'for',
'to'. This seems logical, as prepositions are often necessary to describe the
relationship between words in a sentence. These seem like obvious choices
in hindsight. Similarly, words like 'and' and 'a' also seem like obvious
choices. These were words simply did not come to mind when we were making our
guesses.

Question 3.

(1) 'NN'   f = 15872

(10) 'VBD' f = 2531

Question 4.

Results - Most Common Bigrams
('of', 'the')  f = 844
('.', 'The')   f = 659
('in', 'the')  f = 549
(',', 'and')   f = 373
(',', 'the')   f = 364

Results - Most Common Bigrams (no punctuation)

('of', 'the')  f = 844
('in', 'the')  f = 549
('to', 'the')  f = 273
('on', 'the')  f = 239
('for', 'the') f = 217

We found that once the bigrams with punctuation were removed, all of the most
common bigrams involved a preposition followed by the word 'the'. We had
expected that this might occur, because we knew that prepositions and 'the'
were among the most common unigrams. Furthermore, we knew that these words
were often paired together because when we use prepositions they are commonly
followed by the word 'the'.

Question 5.

Types with 1 tag = 92.407%
Tokens with 1 tag= 74.630%

Types with > 2 tags = 0.535%
Tokens with > 2 tags = 6.898%

Question 6

Overall we see that the results from the science fiction category are very
similar to our results from our results from the news category. The only major
difference is the number of types and tokens, and this difference arises only
becuase there are less science fiction files than news files. This tells us
that trends in the most common words, most common bigrams, and most common
tags are relatively consistent regardless of the category of text we are
analyzing. Below you will find questions 1 through 5 answered using the
science fiction category. 

1. Tokens = 14470, Types = 3233

There are less tokens and types in the science fiction category than there are
in news category, which makes sense because the corpus contains 6 scifi files
and 44 news files. Notably, the ratio of tokens to types is similar for both
categories despite the large difference in number of files. There are ~5 tokens
per type in the science fiction category and ~7 tokens/type in the news
category.

2. Educated Guess - Most Common Words
(1) 'the' 
(2) ','   
(3) '.'   
(4) 'of'  
(5) 'and' 
(6) 'to'  
(7) 'a'   
(8) 'in'  
(9) 'for' 
(10) 'The'

Actual Results - Most Common Words
        (1) ','         f = 791
        (2) '.'         f = 781
        (3) 'the'       f = 652
        (4) 'of'        f = 321
        (5) 'to'        f = 305
        (6) 'and'       f = 278
        (7) "''"        f = 235
        (8) '``'        f = 235
        (9) 'a'         f = 222
        (10) 'was'      f = 198

We chose to use our results from question 2 as our educated guess here because
we learned from the last two labs that the same most common words are often
shared across different texts and categories. This proves true in this case
because of 7 of the 10 words in our guess appear in the actual results.
Instead of 'in', 'The', and 'for', we found that "''", '``', and 'was' were
among the most common words.

3. Most Common Tags
        (1) 'NN'        f = 1653
        (2) 'IN'        f = 1183
        (3) '.'         f = 1078
        (4) 'AT'        f = 1044
        (5) ','         f = 791
        (6) 'JJ'        f = 760
        (7) 'NNS'       f = 561
        (8) 'VBD'       f = 531
        (9) 'RB'        f = 522
        (10) 'VB'       f = 497

The most common tags for files in the science fiction category are nearly
identical to the most common tags for those in the news category. The only
difference was that the tags 'NP' and 'CC' among the top 10 most common tags
for files in the news category, and 'RB' and 'VB' were among the top 10 most
common tags for files in the science fiction category. The similarities of the
most common tags between these two categories suggest that different categories
tend to use words with the same parts of speech with relatively consistent
frequencies.


4. Most Common Bigrams
('.', '``')     f = 148
("''", '.')     f = 98
('of', 'the')   f = 82
('?', '?')      f = 79
('.', 'The')    f = 64

Most Common Bigrams (no punctuation)
('of', 'the')   f = 82
('in', 'the')   f = 36
('to', 'the')   f = 29
('he', 'had')   f = 26
('and', 'the')  f = 26

We found that once the bigrams with punctuation were removed, the most
common bigrams typically had 'the' as their second word. We expected this to
occur based on our results from question 4. The only unexpected result was
('he', 'had'). However, it seems reasonable that this would be among the most
common bigrams.

This result is very similar to our result from question 4. The similarities
in the most common bigrams between these two categories suggest that different
categories tend to use the same word pairings with relatively consistent
frequencies.

5. Types with 1 tag = 93.690%
   Tokens with 1 tag= 81.596%
   
   Types with > 2 tags = 0.371%
   Tokens with > 2 tags = 1.700%

These results are very similar to the ones yielded from analyzing texts from 
the news category. In both cases, the percentage of types with 1 tag is over
90% while the percentage of types with > 2 tags is less than 1%. There are 
slight differences between the percentages concerning tokens. However, in both
categories, we find that the percentage of tokens with 1 tag is less than the
percentage of types with 1 tag and the percentage of tokens with 2 or more
tags is greater than the number of types with 2 tags. 


Question 8.

For this first iteration, we decided to assign each previously unseen word  
the most frequent tag found in the training text, 'NN'. We chose not to
assign the tag randomly because some tags are more rare and particular to
a small list of specific types. Such tags would unlikely yield correct answers.
One other choice we could have considered might have involved using the second,
or third most frequent tags. However, we suspect that this would be slightly
less accurate than using the most frequently found tag in the training set.

By using the most frequently found tag in the training set to tag previously
unseen words, we tagged ~84.8% of the test words correctly. 

Question 9.

We were sastisfied with our accuracy. However, when we looked at the top 10
most incorrectly tagged tokens, we were surprised to see that largest error 
occured because our tagger tagged the word 'to' as 'TO' rather than the correct
tag, 'IN'. We found that in our training courpus that the ratio of 'TO' to 'IN'
tags associated with the word 'to' was 869:650. Assuming that a similar
trend is true in the test text, it makes sense that this was a common mistake,
because the word 'to' will always be tagged as 'TO' by our system. 

The second most common incorrectly tagged word is 'that'. Our tagger 
incorrectly tags it as 'CS' when its actual tag is 'DT' 44 times. It 
also mistags 'that' when its actual tag is 'WPS' 38 times. However, once 
again, when we look at the token's distribution of tags, the miscounts aren't 
entirely surprising. In the training corpus 'CS' accounts for 369 tokens, 
'WPS' account for 89 and 'DT' accounts for 80. 'it', 'Congo'
'Player', 'as', 'home', 'than', and 'libraries' accounted for the remaining
words in the list of top 10 most commonly mistagged in that order. 

Overall we understand the shortcomings of our system. When a word appears
frequently and it has multiple tags that are commonly used, it is especially
difficult to predict tags for that word. Greater accuracy for our tagging
system would require more information that our histogram currently provides.

Question 10. 

Our tagger accurately tags ~25.3% of the words in the test corpus that 
don't occur in the training corpus. Interestingly, the majority of
the top 10 most incorrectly tagged words are different types of nouns,
ie. words with 'NP', 'NNS', or 'NPS' tags. Our current method method for
taggin unknown words is to use the most common tag found in the training
corpus, 'NN'. Unfortunately the 'NN' tag doesn't cover these other noun
occurances.

We reconstructed our tagger so that instead of assigning the most frequent
tag from the training text to previously unseen words, it assigns randomly-
chosen tags from the list ['AT', ',', '.', 'IN', 'CC', 'AT', 'IN','TO', 'IN',
 'IN'], which contains the top 10 most common tags found in the training
corpus. Using this new rubric for handling unknown words, the tagger's 
performace decreases. It tags only ~6-7% of the unknown words correctly. Like
before, the majority of the incorrectly tagged words consists of nouns.

This confirms that the decision we used to handle unseen words using the
most common tag (as we did in Question 8) is more effective than assigning
tags randomly. 

Question 11. 

We chose to redo Question 9 by replacing the test text with texts from 
the 'romance' category. We guessed that our tagger would not perform
as well because our lab from last week showed that the 'romance'
and 'news' corpus are the least alike among three different categories:
romance, news, and adventure. Like before, we had our tagger to assign 
unknown words the most common tag found in the training corpus, 'NN'. 
We didn't expect to see a significant difference in our results because
the most common words in one text are usually the most common in another.
They are also used in the same manner, which would mean that the common
tags show up with relatively the same frequency. 

Our tagger tagged ~83.0% of words correctly, which is a marginal drop
in comparison to the 84.8% acheived using a test text of the same category
as the training text. This matches our prediction. The most common incorrect
tag once again involved 'to', which was tagged with a 'TO' when it had an 'IN' tag 593 times.
